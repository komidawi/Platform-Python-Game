## Description

A simple platform game created in Python using PyGame library and Tiled Map Editor.

It was the first project I have ever made. Although it's mostly just modified tutorial code, I like it as it's memento of my start with the "real IT world" adventure.

## Features:
* fully playable
* high difficulty level
* atmospheric music
